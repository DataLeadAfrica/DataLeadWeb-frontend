            Nigeria is home to over 220 million people, making it the world’s
            most populous Black nation. Yet, despite this scale, the country
            still lacks accurate, disability-disaggregated data. We do not know,
            with certainty, how many Nigerians are Deaf, blind, or living with
            other disabilities. Estimates by global agencies suggest that around
            15% of Nigerians, over 30 million people live with one form of
            disability, but the true figure remains unclear. Even more
            concerning is that no official record exists on the population of
            Deaf persons in Nigeria. Without data, Deaf citizens remain
            invisible to policymakers, planners, and investors. Invisible in
            numbers means invisible in development.
          </p>
          <p>When Data Excludes, Development Falters</p>
          <p>
            Data drives budgets, programs, and priorities. But when disability
            data is missing, so is the inclusion it enables. Across many African
            countries, national statistics offices still collect disability
            information as an afterthought. Questionnaires are designed without
            input from persons with disabilities. Enumerators are not trained in
            sign language. Data collection tools are not accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is predictable: undercounting, misclassification, and
            silence. When we fail to measure inclusion, we fail to achieve it.

          <p> Deaf-in-Tech: Reclaiming Representation in the Data Economy</p>
          <p>
            At Deaf-in-Tech, we are changing this dynamic. Our mission is
            simple: to ensure that Deaf persons are not just subjects of data,
            but producers, analysts, and interpreters of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We train Deaf youth in Power BI, Python, and Microsoft Excel,
            helping them move from being passive data points to active
            participants in the data economy. Through accessible,
            sign-language-based teaching, we are proving that Deaf individuals
            can master complex statistical concepts, build dashboards, and
            analyze national datasets.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our trainees recently analyzed education data to visualize
            how many Deaf children are missing from formal schooling. Another
            developed a health data dashboard that revealed accessibility gaps
            in clinic locations. These examples illustrate what happens when
            inclusion meets capacity, when Deaf professionals use data to tell
            their own stories.
          </p>
          <p> Data for Everyone Must Include Everyone</p>
          <p>
            The theme of this year’s World Statistics Day, “Driving Change with
            Quality Statistics and Data for Everyone,” challenges the world to
            make data more inclusive. For us, it means ensuring that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Disability-disaggregated data is part of every national survey.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deaf people are trained and involved in how data is collected,
              processed, and used.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sign language interpreters are part of data collection teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accessible visualization tools and communication channels are
              standard practice.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Data quality is not only about accuracy and precision. It is also
            about representation and participation.
          </p>

            The Fourth Industrial Revolution Has Begun, But Who Is Counting the
            Deaf?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is powered by data. From
            artificial intelligence to cloud analytics, every industry today
            depends on the ability to collect, interpret, and act on data. Yet
            the Deaf community, especially in Africa, remains largely excluded.
          </p>
          <p> Why? Because statistics are not taught in sign language.</p>
          <p>
            Across Nigeria, there are almost no teachers equipped to explain
            statistical or data science concepts in the native language of the
            Deaf. Without access to statistical education, Deaf learners are
            shut out of the most powerful revolution of our time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deaf-in-Tech is changing that paradigm. We are creating a space
            where Deaf learners can study data analytics in sign language,
            understand the logic behind algorithms, and apply their skills in
            real-world contexts. We are not just teaching statistics; we are
            translating access into opportunity.
          </p>
          <p> Driving Change with Deaf Inclusion</p>
          <p>
            The future of data must be inclusive, or it will continue to
            reproduce inequality. Nigeria cannot drive change with quality
            statistics if millions of Deaf citizens remain uncounted and
            unrepresented.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Deaf-in-Tech, we believe that every dataset should reflect the
            diversity of human experience. Every bar chart should carry the
            stories of those behind the numbers. Every data policy should
            include the voices of those most affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the world celebrates World Statistics Day 2025, we stand for a
            simple truth:
          </p>
          <p>
            Data is power. But only inclusive data can drive just and
            sustainable change.
