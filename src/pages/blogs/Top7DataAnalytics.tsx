          <p>
            The demand for data analysts in Nigeria has never been higher. From
            banks and tech startups to NGOs and government agencies,
            organizations are actively seeking professionals who can turn raw
            data into meaningful insights. But in 2025, what exactly are
            employers looking for in a job-ready data analyst?
          </p>
          <p>
            At Data-Lead Africa, we train hundreds of students every year and
            constantly interact with employers across sectors. Based on industry
            trends and feedback, here are the top 7 data analytics skills
            employers in Nigeria want right now.
          </p>

          <p>1. Microsoft Excel - The Foundation of Data Work</p>
          <p>
            Excel remains the first step into data analytics. Employers expect
            you to know how to clean, organize, and analyze data using formulas,
            pivot tables, and charts. While advanced tools exist, Excel is still
            the go-to for quick analysis and reporting in many Nigerian
            workplaces.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
            Tip: Don’t just learn the basics—master advanced functions like
            VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, Power Query, and data modeling.
          </p>

          <p>2. SQL - Speaking the Language of Databases</p>
          <p>
            Every serious organization relies on databases. SQL (Structured
            Query Language) allows you to extract, filter, and manipulate large
            volumes of data directly from company systems. Employers see SQL
            proficiency as a must-have for analysts handling structured data in
            finance, telecoms, logistics, and government projects.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
            Knowing how to write efficient queries makes you stand out
            immediately.
          </p>

          <p>3. Python - Automation and Advanced Analytics</p>
          <p>
            Python is the backbone of modern analytics. Employers value analysts
            who can use Python to automate repetitive tasks, perform statistical
            modeling, and apply machine learning. In Nigeria’s competitive job
            market, adding Python to your skillset signals that you’re not just
            a beginner—you’re ready for advanced data roles.
          </p>

          <p>4. Power BI - Turning Data into Stories</p>
          <p>
            It’s not enough to analyze data—you must communicate it. Power BI
            helps you design interactive dashboards and visualizations that
            decision-makers can understand at a glance. In 2025, Nigerian
            businesses increasingly want analysts who can build professional
            reports that drive strategy.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
            Employers are impressed when you can show real dashboards from past
            projects.
          </p>

          <p>5. Statistical & Research Methods</p>
          <p>
            Beyond tools, employers want analysts who understand the “why”
            behind the data. Knowledge of statistics, sampling, hypothesis
            testing, and evaluation methods is essential for NGOs, research
            firms, and government agencies. Tools like SPSS, STATA, R, or NVivo
            are often required in development and academic projects.
          </p>

          <p>6. Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving</p>
          <p>
            Employers know tools can be taught—but critical thinking sets
            analysts apart. Can you identify the real problem, clean messy data,
            and deliver insights that support decisions? Nigerian employers
            repeatedly say they want analysts who can think with data rather
            than just push buttons.
          </p>

          <p>7. Communication & Data Storytelling</p>
          <p>
            Finally, the most underrated skill: communication. Employers want
            analysts who can write clear reports, present insights to
            non-technical audiences, and use visuals to tell compelling stories.
            In today’s workplace, your ability to explain the “so what?” of your
            analysis is as valuable as the analysis itself.
          </p>
