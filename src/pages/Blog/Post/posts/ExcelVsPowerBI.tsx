        If you are thinking about starting a career in data analytics, you’ve
        probably heard people mention Excel, Power BI, and Python. These three
        tools dominate conversations in Nigeria’s job market, and graduates
        often ask: Which one should I learn first?
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer depends on your background, career goals, and the kind of
        roles you’re targeting. In this guide, we break down each tool, what it
        does, and how to choose your learning path.
      </p>

      <p>1. Microsoft Excel - The Gateway to Data Analytics</p>
      <p>Why learn Excel first?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s the most widely used tool across Nigerian workplaces.</li>
        <li>Great for beginners with no coding background.</li>
        <li>Employers expect every analyst to have strong Excel skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What you can do with Excel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean and organize raw data.</li>
        <li>Perform calculations, lookups, and data validation.</li>
        <li>Create pivot tables and charts for quick reporting.</li>
        <li>Automate tasks with formulas and Power Query.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are a fresh graduate, NYSC member, or someone just testing the
        waters, Excel is the best starting point.
      </p>

      <p>2. Power BI - Turning Data into Dashboards</p>
      <p>Why learn Power BI?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Organizations want analysts who can communicate insights visually.
        </li>
        <li>It’s becoming the go-to tool for business reporting in Nigeria.</li>
        <li>Easy to connect with Excel, SQL, and other data sources.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What you can do with Power BI:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Import and clean data with Power Query.</li>
        <li>Build interactive dashboards and reports.</li>
        <li>Use DAX formulas for deeper analysis.</li>
        <li>Share insights with decision-makers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you already know Excel and want to impress employers with dashboards,
        Power BI should be your next step.
      </p>

      <p>3. Python - The Analyst’s Power Tool</p>
      <p>Why learn Python?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Python is powerful for automation, statistics, and advanced analytics.
        </li>
        <li>
          It’s essential for those who want to move beyond reporting into data
          science, AI, or machine learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nigerian tech companies and global firms increasingly expect analysts
          to know at least basic Python.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What you can do with Python:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automate repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li>Run advanced statistical analysis.</li>
        <li>Build predictive models and machine learning workflows.</li>
        <li>Handle very large datasets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your goal is to grow into a data scientist or tech-heavy role, Python
        is a must.
      </p>

      <p>Which Tool Should You Learn First?</p>
      <p>Here’s a simple roadmap:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Start with Excel → it builds your foundation.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Add Power BI → learn how to tell stories with data.</li>
        <li>
          Step 3: Progress to Python → if you want to enter advanced analytics
          or data science.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Think of it as a ladder: Excel → Power BI → Python.</p>

      <p>Final Word</p>
      <p>
        You don’t need to learn everything at once. The key is to build skills
        in the right order so you can apply them immediately.
