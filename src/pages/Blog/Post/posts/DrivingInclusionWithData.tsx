        Nigeria is home to over 220 million people, making it the world’s most
        populous Black nation. Yet, despite this scale, the country still lacks
        accurate, disability-disaggregated data. We do not know, with certainty,
        how many Nigerians are Deaf, blind, or living with other disabilities.
        Estimates by global agencies suggest that around 15% of Nigerians, over
        30 million people live with one form of disability, but the true figure
        remains unclear. Even more concerning is that no official record exists
        on the population of Deaf persons in Nigeria. Without data, Deaf
        citizens remain invisible to policymakers, planners, and investors.
        Invisible in numbers means invisible in development.

      <p>When Data Excludes, Development Falters</p>
      <p>
        Data drives budgets, programs, and priorities. But when disability data
        is missing, so is the inclusion it enables. Across many African
        countries, national statistics offices still collect disability
        information as an afterthought. Questionnaires are designed without
        input from persons with disabilities. Enumerators are not trained in
        sign language. Data collection tools are not accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is predictable: undercounting, misclassification, and
        silence. When we fail to measure inclusion, we fail to achieve it.

      <p> Deaf-in-Tech: Reclaiming Representation in the Data Economy</p>
      <p>
        At Deaf-in-Tech, we are changing this dynamic. Our mission is simple: to
        ensure that Deaf persons are not just subjects of data, but producers,
        analysts, and interpreters of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We train Deaf youth in Power BI, Python, and Microsoft Excel, helping
        them move from being passive data points to active participants in the
        data economy. Through accessible, sign-language-based teaching, we are
        proving that Deaf individuals can master complex statistical concepts,
        build dashboards, and analyze national datasets.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of our trainees recently analyzed education data to visualize how
        many Deaf children are missing from formal schooling. Another developed
        a health data dashboard that revealed accessibility gaps in clinic
        locations. These examples illustrate what happens when inclusion meets
        capacity, when Deaf professionals use data to tell their own stories.
      </p>
      <p> Data for Everyone Must Include Everyone</p>
      <p>
        The theme of this year’s World Statistics Day, “Driving Change with
        Quality Statistics and Data for Everyone,” challenges the world to make
        data more inclusive. For us, it means ensuring that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disability-disaggregated data is part of every national survey.</li>
        <li>
          Deaf people are trained and involved in how data is collected,
          processed, and used.
        </li>
        <li>Sign language interpreters are part of data collection teams.</li>
        <li>
          Accessible visualization tools and communication channels are standard
          practice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Data quality is not only about accuracy and precision. It is also about
        representation and participation.
      </p>

        The Fourth Industrial Revolution Has Begun, But Who Is Counting the
        Deaf?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is powered by data. From
        artificial intelligence to cloud analytics, every industry today depends
        on the ability to collect, interpret, and act on data. Yet the Deaf
        community, especially in Africa, remains largely excluded.
      </p>
      <p> Why? Because statistics are not taught in sign language.</p>
      <p>
        Across Nigeria, there are almost no teachers equipped to explain
        statistical or data science concepts in the native language of the Deaf.
        Without access to statistical education, Deaf learners are shut out of
        the most powerful revolution of our time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deaf-in-Tech is changing that paradigm. We are creating a space where
        Deaf learners can study data analytics in sign language, understand the
        logic behind algorithms, and apply their skills in real-world contexts.
        We are not just teaching statistics; we are translating access into
        opportunity.
      </p>
      <p> Driving Change with Deaf Inclusion</p>
      <p>
        The future of data must be inclusive, or it will continue to reproduce
        inequality. Nigeria cannot drive change with quality statistics if
        millions of Deaf citizens remain uncounted and unrepresented.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Deaf-in-Tech, we believe that every dataset should reflect the
        diversity of human experience. Every bar chart should carry the stories
        of those behind the numbers. Every data policy should include the voices
        of those most affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the world celebrates World Statistics Day 2025, we stand for a simple
        truth:
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is power. But only inclusive data can drive just and sustainable
        change.
      </p>
