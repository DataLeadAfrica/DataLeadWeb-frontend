        We contributed to the Northern Education Initiative Plus (NEI+), a
        USAID-funded project aiming to improve access to quality education and
        reading skills for over a million children in underserved communities
        (girls, orphans, and those in non-traditional schools) across Bauchi and
        Sokoto states in Nigeria. This was achieved through concise research on
        existing assessments and data collection methods, ensuring the project
        leveraged best practices. We also programmed the data collection tool to
        be compatible with data analysis software, streamlining the process. We
        efficiently managed the data coming in daily from a large team of
        interviewers spread across three states. By collaborating on daily data
        analysis, we prevented backlogs. Finally, we analyzed qualitative data
        to identify key themes that informed the project’s overall findings.
