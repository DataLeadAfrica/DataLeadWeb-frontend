        The objective of this consultancy is to generate robust, evidence-based
        insights that will inform a compelling business case for reusable
        menstrual products in Nigeria. Specifically, the study focused on the
        following objectives:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Assessed the menstrual hygiene product landscape in Bauchi, Lagos, and
          the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), with emphasis on reusable pads,
          while generating nationally relevant insights. This included examining
          product diversity, availability, accessibility, and key gaps that
          affect consumer choice.
        </li>

        <li>
          Mapping of key stakeholders across government, regulatory agencies,
          private sector actors, civil society organisations, and development
          partners. The mapping will document their roles, responsibilities, and
          influence, with a view to identifying levers that can support wider
          adoption of reusable menstrual products.
        </li>

        <li>
          3 Analysed consumer demand factors, including awareness, preferences,
          affordability thresholds, willingness to pay, cultural attitudes, and
          stigma that influence product uptake. This involved comparing
          perceptions and use of reusable pads relative to disposables across
          different socio-economic and geographic contexts.
        </li>

        <li>
          4. Developed an evidence-driven business case that demonstrates the
          market potential of reusable pads, highlights viable consumer
          segments, and presents indicative adoption scenarios. The business
          case will articulate both social and economic value, positioning
          reusable products as a sustainable and investable solution.
