        Our brief tenure (October 10th – November 9th, 2021) as a data analyst
        for JICA’s SHEP Nigeria project in Edo State proved highly impactful.
        Through data analysis of agricultural production, market trends, and
        farmer demographics, we identified crucial links between market-oriented
        extension systems and improved livelihoods. Clear visualizations and
        collaboration with project experts transformed data into actionable
        insights, driving informed decision-making, resource allocation, and
        impactful reports. This ultimately supported data-driven strategies that
        propelled the project’s success and fostered sustainable agricultural
        growth in Edo State.
