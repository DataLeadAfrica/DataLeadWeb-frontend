      <p>
        We played a vital role in the USAID Agribusiness Investment Midterm
        Performance Evaluation. During December 2021 to January 2022, we
        analyzed project data (both quantitative and qualitative) using advanced
        techniques. This analysis yielded key trends and insights that
        contributed to the evaluation report. Our work with the team ensured a
        data-driven understanding of the project’s national impact, progress,
        and areas for improvement. By helping present findings and supporting
        adjustments, you ultimately contributed to the project’s success and
        positive impact on Nigeria’s agribusiness sector.
