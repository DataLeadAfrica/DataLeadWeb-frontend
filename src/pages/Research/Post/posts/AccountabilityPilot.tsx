      <p>
        We played a key role in the “Accountability Pilot” survey, an M&E
        project in Borno State, Nigeria. This project aimed to improve
        accountability by testing new ways to gather feedback from communities.
        These methods included voice recorders and dedicated staff presence to
        collect complaints, provide information (help desk), and address
        concerns. As the M&E Officer and Data Analyst, we trained enumerators
        and oversaw data collection across three districts (Dikwa, Mafa,
        Mongonu) and analyzed data from focus groups (FGDs) and key informant
        interviews (KIIs) to identify themes then we delivered reports with
        findings and recommendations to inform stakeholders on the project’s
        effectiveness and long-term viability.
