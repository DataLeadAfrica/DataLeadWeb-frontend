        The REACH 4 project aimed to improve food security for over 13,500
        conflict-affected families in Damboa, Borno, over a one-year period.
        Here’s what you contributed. To achieve this we trained and supervised
        18 enumerators for data collection in 8 project communities and also
        ensured data quality by implementing Data Quality Assurance measures. We
        collaborated on the evaluation report and presented findings to Mercy
        Corps.
